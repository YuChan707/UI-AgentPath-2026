"""Prompts to generate SYNTHETIC behavior DATA with the Llama 3B.

Each prompt is stored as an ENTITY (`PromptSpec`) with its features:

  * details            -> what the prompt does / what it is for.
  * description_input   -> what input it expects (shape of the arguments).
  * expected_output     -> output contract (shape of the required JSON).
  * output_schema       -> marshmallow Schema used to VALIDATE the output.
  * output_is_list      -> whether the output is an array of entities or a single one.
  * builder             -> assembles {"model","system","user"} for the model.
  * mock                -> valid fixture (runs the pipeline without a real model).

This way we guarantee that what the LLM returns meets the requirements to create
the statistical group entities: `expected_output` documents the contract and
`output_schema` enforces it via `.load()`.

From the real RAW data of a location (Location / LocationStatistics)
four types of output are generated:

  1) BEHAVIOR_MODEL_PROMPT  -> list[BehaviorFormula]
       Reproducible statistical formulas: HOW each behavior metric
       changes according to gender, age, ethnicity, income/class and education.

  2) FIELD_GROUPS_PROMPT    -> list[FieldBehaviorGroup]
       Groups by FIELD/topic (tech, education, entertainment, health,
       finance, politics, family), each with its own behavior model.

  3) GROUP_PROFILE_PROMPT   -> GroupBehaviorProfile
       A group defined by a COMBINATION of factors and its levels as RANGES
       (min / expected / max) -> the "average reaction range scores".

  4) REACTION_PROMPT        -> ReactionProfile
       How a segment reacts to a DIGITAL PRODUCT, with scores and attribution.

The default model is the dockerized LLAMA (LLAMA_MODEL in the environment),
served via Dapr Conversation API or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (see llm_client).

    HARD RULES (non-negotiable):
    - Respond EXCLUSIVELY with valid JSON. No text before or after, no
      markdown, no ```.
    - All scores and probabilities go in the range [0, 1] unless the
      contract says otherwise. Use numbers, not strings.
    - Formulas must be REPRODUCIBLE: given a concrete segment, applying
      the expression + the modifiers must yield a number. Do not invent
      ambiguous notation.
    - Anchor every estimate in the REAL data provided (median_income, age_ranges,
      ethnicity_distribution, unemployment_rate, etc.). If you infer, say so in the
      `rationale` field.
    - factor can ONLY be one of: {_enum(BEHAVIOR_FACTORS)}.
    - metric can ONLY be one of: {_enum(BEHAVIOR_METRICS)}.
    - effect_type ONLY: {_enum(EFFECT_TYPES)}.
    - combination_rule ONLY: {_enum(COMBINATION_RULES)}.
    - segment_value must be coherent with its factor:
        age    -> ranges like "18-24", "25-34", "65+"
        gender -> {_enum(GENDERS)}
        income -> {_enum(INCOME_BRACKETS)}   (social class: low=lowest ... high=highest)
        education -> {_enum(EDUCATION_LEVELS)}
        field  -> {_enum(FIELD_DOMAINS)}
        ethnicity -> use the labels present in ethnicity_distribution.
    - ETHICS: model aggregated statistical TRENDS, never deterministic
      traits of an individual. No offensive stereotypes; ethnicity and
      income are treated as population correlations, with humility in
      `confidence`. Do not invent PII (names, emails, addresses).
    - Always mark "generated_by": "llm".
